# Excel-Movie-IMDB

Excel-Movie-IMDB is a Python project that uses PyMovieDb and Openpyxl libraries to import movie metadata from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and export it to an Excel spreadsheet.

## Installation

Before running the application, make sure that you have Python 3 installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/NikolusW/Excel-Movie-IMDB.git

2. Install the required libraries by running the following command in the project directory:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing the following command in the project directory:

python Cinemanoer.py

2. Follow the prompts to enter the name of the movie you want to search for and the filename for the Excel spreadsheet that you want to export the movie metadata to.

## Additional Features

In addition to the command-line application, the project can be expanded to include a GUI. This will make it easier for users to interact with the application and provide a more user-friendly experience.

To add a GUI to the application, you can use a Python GUI toolkit such as Tkinter or PyQT. The GUI can be used to input movie names and export movie metadata to an Excel spreadsheet in the same way as the command-line application.
